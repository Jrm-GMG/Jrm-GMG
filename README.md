I have decided to post some of my projects as well as some of my implementations in this public profil. They will be posted gradually since some need to be reworked to be presentable, and I want to have a small report for each of them. Some are small projects to apply methods and study them. Others are implementations of papers. Coming soon: YOLO paper implementation, UNET, and Transformers.
